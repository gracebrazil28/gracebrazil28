### 👋 Hello, I'm Grace!
🎓I'm a current masters student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology (MSCS), I leverage my electrical engineering background (BSEE) and love of mathematics to delve deeper into Machine Learning, particularly the circuit-view of neural networks.

🚀My industry experience in software integration and testing has equipped me with a solid foundation, and I'm constantly expanding my skill set by exploring cloud architecture and tinkering with ML tools like PyTorch and Keras API for rapid development (check out my Colab Notebooks).

✍️I'm also thrilled to be starting a research apprenticeship with an NSF-funded program this summer, CRA-WP will be supporting my summer research project. 

🧠Continuing in the fall, I will be working as a graduate research assistant with the Design Intelligence Lab on the IVY Project (AI ALOE) headed by Dr. Ashok Goel. 

🦉My research interests are cognitive AI representations, human-machine collaboration, responsible artificial intelligence.

💬 Ask me about...

🤖 Reinforcement Learning in Trading: Having recently learned how to use QLearning in interpreting indicators, let’s discuss how to explore reinforcement learning technique such as QLearning into trading strategies. P.S. Tread lightly and do not buy into hype!

📡 5G Protocol: With experience as a 5G Systems Senior Engineer at Qualcomm, I'm ready to dive into discussions about the intricacies of 5G technology, protocols, and advancements shaping the future of telecommunications.

🏞️ Cities and Towns in Northern Spain: Planning a trip to Northern Spain in summer 2024? I've got you covered. Ask me about the best places to visit, hidden gems, and must-see attractions in this picturesque region.
