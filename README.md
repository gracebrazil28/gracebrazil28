### 👋 Hello, I'm Grace!
  🎓I'm a Master’s student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, building on my electrical engineering background (BSEE) and nearly 4 years of professional experience in software testing, systems integration, and automation.

  🎉 **I’ll be attending the Grace Hopper Conference 2024 in Philadelphia from October 8-11!**

  🚀My industry experience in software integration and testing has equipped me with a solid foundation. I worked full-time at Qualcomm for nearly 4 years and interned at Intel and Motorola Solutions during undergrad.

  💻 Currently, I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Design Intelligence Lab, where I’m expanding my skills in backend development with AWS, building scalable solutions, and working on AI-driven projects like the IVY Chatbot Agent.

  🛠️I'm constantly expanding my skill set through tinkering with ML tools like PyTorch and Keras API for rapid development (check out my Colab Notebooks).

  🦉My research interests are cognitive AI representations, human-machine collaboration, responsible artificial intelligence.

💬 Ask me about...

  📡 5G Protocol: With experience as a 5G Systems Senior Engineer at Qualcomm, I'm ready to dive into discussions about the intricacies of 5G technology, protocols, and advancements shaping the future of telecommunications.

  🤖 Developing and Deploying Agent Monitoring: While working at Design Intelligence Lab, I've worked on backend development, designing and implementing key components for the IVY Chatbot Agent. This includes the LLM-based module called MetaCognitiveAgent that queries OpenAI and utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for enhanced contextual responses.

  🏞️ Cities and Towns in Northern Spain: Planning a trip to Northern Spain in summer 2025? I can give you some recommendations. Ask me about the best places to visit, hidden gems, and must-see attractions in this picturesque region. (Bonus: What to do in Lisbon and Porto, Portugal).
