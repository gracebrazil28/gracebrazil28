### 👋 Hello, I'm Grace!
🎓I'm a current graduate student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology (MSCS), I leverage my electrical engineering background (BSEE) to delve deeper into Machine Learning.

🚀My industry experience in software integration and testing has equipped me with a solid foundation, and I'm constantly expanding my skill set by exploring Cloud Architecture and Solutions (AWS, Google Cloud) and tinkering with cutting-edge tools like PyTorch and Keras API for rapid development (check out my Colab Notebooks).

✍️I'm also thrilled to be starting a research apprenticeship with an NSF-funded program this summer, CRA-WP will be supporting my summer research project. 

🧠Continuing in the fall, I will be working as a graduate research assistant with the Design Intelligence Lab on the IVY Project (AI ALOE) headed by Dr. Ashok Goel. My research aims to bridge the gap between Cognitive AI's problem-solving models, specifically the TMK framework, and the context-aware question-answering and explanation generation capabilities of Generative AI. Essentially, I'll be exploring how these AI models, particularly the TMK model, can be leveraged to promote active learning in students.

🦉My research interests are cognitive AI representations, human-machine collaboration, responsible artificial intelligence.
